# network_automation_app
A python program to remotely configure multiple switched simultaneously.

For testing I used the following tools:

1. Virtual Box - https://www.virtualbox.org
2. Arista Virtual Machine - https://www.eos.arista.com/veos-running-eos-in-a-vm
3. Putty - https://www.putty.org

Arista Virtual machine configurations are saved in the project folder in the arista_conf.txt file.
